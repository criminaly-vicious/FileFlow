# FileFlow Development Status

## What has been done

*   **Project Setup:** The basic project structure has been created with Electron, React, and TypeScript.
*   **Frontend UI:** A basic user interface has been implemented with React, including:
    *   File and folder navigation.
    *   Create, Rename, Delete, and Move operations (simulated).
    *   File type icons and a basic file "view" functionality.
    *   A basic search bar.
*   **Git Repository:** The project has been initialized as a Git repository and the initial commit has been pushed to the `main` branch of `https://github.com/criminaly-vicious/FileFlow.git`.
*   **README.md:** A `README.md` file has been created with a project description, contribution guidelines, and a summary of what has been done and what is pending.

## What is pending (Features)

*   **Backend Implementation (Rust):** The Rust backend for handling file system operations needs to be implemented. This is currently blocked due to issues with the `cargo` command in the development environment.
*   **Advanced Search:** The search functionality needs to be expanded to include searching by type, date, and content.
*   **Cloud Storage Integration:** Integration with services like Google Drive and Dropbox is planned.
*   **Testing:** Comprehensive testing of all functionalities.
*   **Polishing:** UI/UX improvements and bug fixes.
